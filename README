pyquake3

A complete rewrite of Gerald Kaszuba's pyquake3 Python module.
Yes, it's a bit over-designed. Yes, the mixin class is scary.
Yes, it fixes a number of problems with the original. No, it's
not 100% backwards compatible.

The pyquake3 module is used to talk to Quake 3 servers from
Python scripts, so server browsers, statistics tools, and
administration interfaces are the main applications.

This version of pyquake3 was developed for (and tested with)
Urban Terror 4.1 on ioQuake3 1.36 dedicated servers. I hope
it'll work for other Quake 3 games as well. If it doesn't,
I'd be happy to fix things for your favorite game if you
send me enough information to do so. Better yet, send a patch.
